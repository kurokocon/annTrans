annTrans is an annotation transfer tool designed to annotate de novo transcriptome assemblies
The tool is designed to incorporate large flexibility and be applicable to wide range of biological contexts of transcriptome assembly tasks, from annotating of an entirely new genome to generating a more accurate genome annotation of a particular strain of a well-studied model organism. 
To achieve this flexibility, annTrans combines: a) leveraging of existing functional genome annotation for de novo assembly annotation, b) incorporating functional predictions for novel genomic features, c) fine-tunable process of matching the predicted and known genomic features.
